| TC-01            | Verify OpenShift Cluster Configuration                 | Ensure OpenShift is correctly configured to integrate with Vault.    | 1. Verify the Vault address is set correctly in OpenShift (`VAULT_ADDR`).<br>2. Ensure OpenShift service account has access to Vault.<br>3. Check Vault role and policies. | OpenShift should be configured to interact with Vault.<br>Vault URL and credentials should be set properly. |
| TC-02            | Create AppRole in Vault                               | Validate AppRole creation and configuration in Vault.               | 1. Enable AppRole: `vault auth enable approle`.<br>2. Create AppRole: `vault write auth/approle/role/<role_name>`.<br>3. Verify role: `vault read auth/approle/role/<role_name>`. | AppRole should be created successfully and Vault should return the AppRole's details. |
| TC-03            | Test OpenShift Authentication with Vault using AppRole | Verify OpenShift can authenticate with Vault using AppRole.          | 1. Ensure OpenShift has Role ID and Secret ID.<br>2. Configure Vault client with AppRole credentials.<br>3. Authenticate: `vault login -method=approle`.<br>4. Validate successful authentication. | OpenShift should authenticate successfully with Vault and receive a token. |
| TC-04            | Test Vault Token Access to Secrets                    | Verify OpenShift can access secrets from Vault after authentication. | 1. Authenticate to Vault.<br>2. Access a secret: `vault kv get secret/my-secret`.<br>3. Validate access based on AppRole policies. | OpenShift should retrieve the secret from Vault successfully. |
| TC-05            | Verify Token Renewal                                  | Ensure token can be renewed and session remains valid.              | 1. Authenticate with AppRole.<br>2. Check TTL: `vault token lookup`.<br>3. Renew token: `vault token renew`.<br>4. Verify renewed token. | Token should be renewable and TTL extended. |
| TC-06            | Verify Vault Access Control via Policies              | Test that Vault policies restrict access to the correct resources.   | 1. Create Vault policy restricting access.<br>2. Attach policy to AppRole.<br>3. Test access to resources and verify policy enforcement. | OpenShift should only access permitted resources as per Vault policy. |
| TC-07            | Test AppRole Secret ID Expiry                         | Validate secret ID expiration behavior.                              | 1. Create AppRole with Secret ID TTL.<br>2. Authenticate with Secret ID.<br>3. Wait for expiration.<br>4. Attempt authentication with expired Secret ID. | After TTL expires, the Secret ID should become invalid and authentication should fail. |
| TC-08            | Test Role ID Access and Secret ID Generation          | Ensure Role ID and Secret ID generation works correctly.            | 1. Generate Role ID: `vault read auth/approle/role/<role_name>/role-id`.<br>2. Generate Secret ID: `vault write -f auth/approle/role/<role_name>/secret-id`.<br>3. Authenticate with generated credentials. | Role ID and Secret ID should be generated successfully. Vault should authenticate correctly. |
| TC-09            | Verify AppRole Access from Multiple OpenShift Nodes    | Ensure AppRole authentication works across multiple OpenShift nodes. | 1. Set up a multi-node OpenShift environment.<br>2. Authenticate using AppRole on multiple nodes.<br>3. Verify successful authentication and access. | Authentication should work across all OpenShift nodes without issues. |
| TC-10            | Check AppRole Locking Mechanism                       | Verify AppRole gets locked after invalid login attempts.            | 1. Attempt multiple invalid logins.<br>2. Check Vault logs for AppRole lock.<br>3. Attempt authentication after lock. | AppRole should be locked after defined failed attempts and authentication should fail. |
