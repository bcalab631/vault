1. Led the integration of the ETS application, hosted in the PICO data center, with HashiCorp Vault for secure secrets management.
Successfully completed a proof of concept (POC) to test the integration technique, providing secure and efficient application secret storage and retrieval. Developed a fault-tolerant solution based on a Vault Proxy, allowing the ETS application to continue working even if connectivity to the Vault instance in the data center is lost. This approach allows local access to cached secrets, which improves the application's resilience and security posture. The final solution design was documented and given over to the application owner for testing and implementation, marking a significant step toward modernizing secrets management in the ETS environment.

2. Led the successful proof of concept (POC) to integrate OpenShift with HashiCorp Vault using the Vault Agent Injector.
Led the successful proof of concept (POC) to integrate OpenShift with HashiCorp Vault using the Vault Agent Injector.
Conducted a thorough technical study of several Vault integration solutions, including Vault Agent Injector, Vault CSI Driver, and Vault Secret Operator. Each solution was evaluated for security, scalability, simplicity of integration, and operational complexity. Based on the results of this research, Vault Agent Injector was selected as the most appropriate solution for the organization's requirements. 

I took ownership of the entire process, from planning to design to implementation. Collaborated extensively with stakeholders from platform teams, application owners, and enterprise architects to ensure that security and integration requirements are met. Developed a scalable and secure system that allows secrets to be automatically injected into OpenShift pods at runtime using the Vault Agent Injector, eliminating the need to store secrets in etcd, which is insecure . Implemented the solution in a lower-level environment, allowing application teams to test and validate it. This effort not only validated the integration's capability, but also defined a repeatable pattern for future OpenShift workloads that require secure secret management.

3. Swiftly deployed a HashiCorp Vault Disaster Recovery (DR) cluster for the new data center.
We delivered the Vault DR cluster ahead of schedule, ensuring high availability and resilience for secret management in the new data center. Followed best practices for safe setup, replication, and failover configuration to provide seamless continuity in the case of a primary cluster loss. As part of new datacenter strategy established the groundwork for enterprise-grade secret management

4. Provided critical on-call support for HashiCorp Vault. 
Actively engaged in the on-call cycle, responding to alerts and incidents in a timely fashion. To minimize the impact on business-critical applications, I took on the responsibility of debugging and resolving Vault-related issues, which were frequently time-sensitive. Proactively addressing incidents and cooperating with application teams helped to maintain system stability and prevent escalation. This hands-on support guaranteed that Vault remained operational and reliable as a critical component of the company infrastructure.

5.Upskilling:

Proactively pursued professional development by completing the GCP Associate Cloud Engineer training program, which provided hands-on exposure with essential Google Cloud services, infrastructure, and best practices for implementing and managing cloud solutions. The certification exam is scheduled for June 15th, demonstrating a commitment to continuous learning and cloud expertise.

I completed the Pluralsight courses "Docker Deep Dive" and "Docker and Kubernetes: The Big Picture" to improve my knowledge of containerization and orchestration. This knowledge has improved my ability to contribute to the Openshift integration with Hashicorp Vault.

Summary of Key Accomplishments (Midyear):

Secrets Management Leadership: Led the integration of the ETS application and OpenShift platform with HashiCorp Vault by completing successful proof-of-concepts (POCs). Designed secure, fault-tolerant solutions using Vault Proxy and Vault Agent Injector, enabling automated and resilient secrets handling in production-like environments.

Infrastructure Resilience: Independently deployed a HashiCorp Vault Disaster Recovery (DR) cluster for a new data center, ahead of schedule. Ensured secure replication, failover readiness, and continuous availability of secrets management as part of the broader data center strategy.

Operational Reliability: Took a lead role in on-call support for Vault, responding swiftly to incidents, resolving issues under pressure, and maintaining service continuity for critical applicationsâ€”preventing any escalations.

Ongoing Skill Development: Completed the GCP Associate Cloud Engineer training (exam scheduled for June 15) and Pluralsight courses on Docker and Kubernetes fundamentals. These learning efforts enhanced technical knowledge in cloud infrastructure, containerization, and application platform integration.
