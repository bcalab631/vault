Currently, HashiCorp Vault lacks the ability to list the keys in its user interface, which hampers usersâ€™ ability to easily manage and track keys within the Vault UI. Additionally, consumers are facing inconsistent issues when attempting to update keys in the Vault KV engine using API commands, leading to operational challenges and inefficiencies across the enterprise. To address these issues, there is a need to develop a web interface with a Python backend that can list all the keys stored in the Vault, as well as provide functionality to patch or update the required keys. This solution aims to bring consistency to key management across the enterprise and enhance user experience by streamlining the process of key updates.
