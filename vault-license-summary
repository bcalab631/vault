🔄 Summary: Vault Kubernetes License Consumption Test Cases
✅ Test Case 1: alias_name_source = serviceaccount_uid
🔍 Purpose
To verify that Vault license consumption is based on the UID of a Kubernetes service account.

⚙️ Behavior Observed
Vault consumes 1 license per unique service account UID.

Deploying multiple pods with the same ServiceAccount (same UID) → no extra license used.

Deleting and recreating the ServiceAccount (generates a new UID) → additional license consumed.

🧠 Conclusion
Vault treats each unique UID as a new identity, consuming a separate license. This behavior is useful when enforcing strict identity boundaries, but can increase license usage in environments where ServiceAccounts are frequently recreated.

✅ Test Case 2: alias_name_source = serviceaccount_name
🔍 Purpose
To verify that Vault license consumption is based on the name of a Kubernetes service account, regardless of UID.

⚙️ Behavior Observed
Vault consumes 1 license per unique service account name.

Multiple pods using the same ServiceAccount → no extra license consumed.

Deleting and recreating the ServiceAccount (new UID, same name) → no extra license consumed.

🧠 Conclusion
Vault identifies clients based on service account name, not UID. This approach is efficient for environments with dynamic or recreated service accounts, reducing license usage at the cost of granularity.

| Feature                      | `serviceaccount_uid`       | `serviceaccount_name`        |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **License Bound To**         | ServiceAccount UID         | ServiceAccount Name          |
| **Multiple Pods w/ Same SA** | 1 license                  | 1 license                    |
| **Recreate SA (new UID)**    | New license consumed       | No new license consumed      |
| **Granularity**              | High (per UID)             | Low (per name)               |
| **License Efficiency**       | Lower (more licenses used) | Higher (fewer licenses used) |
