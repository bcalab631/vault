OpenShift and Vault Injector POC Documentation
1. Overview
1.1 Purpose
This document summarizes the Proof of Concept (POC) conducted to evaluate the integration of HashiCorp Vault Injector with Red Hat OpenShift. The primary goal was to validate the capability of securely injecting secrets into applications running in OpenShift without embedding credentials in image builds or configuration files.

1.2 Objectives
Demonstrate dynamic secret injection in containers using Vault Agent Injector.

Validate seamless integration with OpenShift workloads.

Assess security, manageability, and operational feasibility.

Document configurations, test scenarios, and results.

2. POC Solution Design
2.1 Architecture Diagram (optional – let me know if you'd like a visual aid)
The POC involved the following components:

HashiCorp Vault (deployed in dev mode for POC purposes).

Vault Agent Injector sidecar to inject secrets.

OpenShift Cluster (version X.Y).

Test Applications deployed with annotated pods for Vault Injector.

Kubernetes Auth Method in Vault for authentication.

2.2 Flow Summary
Vault is initialized and unsealed.

Vault Kubernetes auth is enabled and configured.

A Vault policy is created to allow reading specific secrets.

A Kubernetes service account is mapped to a Vault role.

Application pods are annotated to trigger the Vault Injector.

Secrets are injected into the pod at runtime via shared volume.

2.3 Technologies Used
OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)

HashiCorp Vault

Vault Agent Injector

Kubernetes native features (RBAC, ServiceAccount, Secrets)

Helm / kubectl / oc for deployment and configuration

3. Configuration Details
3.1 Vault Setup
Mode: Dev mode / HA setup (specify what was used)

Auth method: Kubernetes

Policy:

hcl
Copy
Edit
path "secret/data/app/*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
Role Mapping:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "bound_service_account_names": ["vault-auth"],
  "bound_service_account_namespaces": ["default"],
  "policies": ["app-policy"],
  "ttl": "1h"
}
3.2 Injector Setup
Helm chart version or manual deployment notes.

Annotations used in deployment YAML:

yaml
Copy
Edit
vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: "true"
vault.hashicorp.com/role: "app-role"
vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-config.txt: "secret/data/app/config"
4. Test Scenarios and Results
Test Case	Description	Expected Result	Actual Result	Status
TC1	Deploy app with Vault annotations	Secret injected in volume	Success	✅
TC2	Invalid service account	Vault auth fails	Error observed	✅
TC3	Missing policy access	Secret denied	Access error as expected	✅
TC4	Secret update in Vault	Updated secret injected in new pod	Verified	✅

Add logs or sample screenshots if necessary for reference.

5. POC Outcome
5.1 Observations
Vault Injector worked reliably for dynamic secret injection.

OpenShift RBAC and Vault policies provided fine-grained control.

Some latency during sidecar init phase observed in large deployments.

5.2 Challenges
Initial setup of Vault K8s auth was sensitive to incorrect service account token permissions.

Secrets are only refreshed on pod restart in current injector setup.

5.3 Recommendations
For production, consider:

HA Vault deployment with storage backend.

Integrating secret rotation workflows.

Monitoring Vault Injector logs and health.

6. Conclusion
The POC successfully demonstrated the integration of HashiCorp Vault with OpenShift using Vault Agent Injector for dynamic secret injection. It validates the approach as secure, manageable, and scalable for enterprise applications.
