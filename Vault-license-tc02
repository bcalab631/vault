Test Case 2
Title: Vault License Consumption Test with alias_name_source = serviceaccount_name
Purpose: Validate that Vault consumes only one license per service account name, regardless of the UID, when alias_name_source = serviceaccount_name is used.

üîß Test Environment Setup
Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster (OCP)

Vault Enterprise with license tracking

Kubernetes auth method enabled in Vault

Vault role created using alias_name_source = serviceaccount_name

üîê Vault Kubernetes Auth Role Configuration
bash
Copy
Edit
vault write auth/kubernetes/role/cml16-role-name \
    bound_service_account_names=cml16-license-sa1 \
    bound_service_account_namespaces=default \
    alias_name_source=serviceaccount_name \
    policies=default \
    ttl=1h
üìã Test Steps and Expected Results
| **Step** | **Action**                                                                            | **Expected Result**                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Create a new Kubernetes service account named `cml16-license-sa1`.                    | ServiceAccount created in `default` namespace.                       |
| 2        | Configure the Vault K8s auth role using `alias_name_source = serviceaccount_name`.    | Vault role created successfully.                                     |
| 3        | List and note the UID of the service account.                                         | UID (e.g., `uid-abc`) recorded (for comparison only).                |
| 4        | Deploy a pod using the service account `cml16-license-sa1` and authenticate to Vault. | Pod runs and successfully authenticates to Vault.                    |
| 5        | Check Vault license usage using `vault license status` or `/sys/license/status`.      | **1 client** is consumed, identified by service account **name**.    |
| 6        | Deploy a second pod using the same service account `cml16-license-sa1`.               | Pod authenticates successfully.                                      |
| 7        | Check Vault license usage again.                                                      | Still **1 client** consumed (same SA name reused).                   |
| 8        | Delete and recreate the service account `cml16-license-sa1` (UID changes).            | New UID generated, but name remains the same.                        |
| 9        | Deploy another pod using the new `cml16-license-sa1` and authenticate.                | Authentication works.                                                |
| 10       | Check Vault license usage one final time.                                             | Still **1 client** consumed (same service account **name** is used). |


‚úÖ Validation Criteria
License usage is tied to service account name, not UID.

Recreating a service account with the same name does not consume an additional Vault license.

Vault creates only one identity alias for the service account name.

üí° Rationale
This test confirms that when alias_name_source = serviceaccount_name:

Vault treats service account name as the identity key.

UID changes (due to recreation) do not impact licensing.

Helps reduce license consumption in ephemeral environments where service accounts are frequently recreated.

üß™ Additional Checks (Optional)
Use Vault CLI or API to confirm the entity alias:

bash
Copy
Edit
vault list identity/entity-alias
vault read identity/entity-alias/<alias_id>
This helps validate that only one alias exists for cml16-license-sa1, regardless of how many times the SA was recreated.
