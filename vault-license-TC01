Test Case 1: Vault License Consumption with alias_name_source = serviceaccount_uid
Objective:
Verify that Vault license consumption is tied to the Service Account UID, not just the Service Account name, when using Kubernetes authentication with alias_name_source = serviceaccount_uid.

âœ… Preconditions
Vault is properly set up with Kubernetes auth method enabled.

Vault enterprise license is in use and license usage metrics are accessible.

Vault Kubernetes auth role is configured with alias_name_source = serviceaccount_uid.

| Step | Description                                                                         | Expected Result                                                 |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Create a new OCP ServiceAccount named `cml16-license-sa`.                           | ServiceAccount is successfully created in the target namespace. |
| 2    | Configure Vault Kubernetes auth role with `alias_name_source = serviceaccount_uid`. | Auth role is created with correct parameters.                   |
| 3    | List the UID of the created ServiceAccount.                                         | UID is recorded (e.g., `uid-1234`).                             |
| 4    | Deploy a pod using `cml16-license-sa` ServiceAccount.                               | Pod is successfully running using the ServiceAccount.           |
| 5    | Ensure Vault token is requested and authenticated from the pod.                     | Authentication succeeds.                                        |
| 6    | Check Vault license usage (`vault license status`).                                 | **1 license** consumed (one unique UID used).                   |
| 7    | Deploy another pod with the **same** ServiceAccount.                                | Pod is running and authenticates to Vault.                      |
| 8    | Check Vault license usage.                                                          | Still **1 license** consumed (same UID reused).                 |
| 9    | Delete and recreate the same-named ServiceAccount (`cml16-license-sa`).             | New ServiceAccount has a **different UID**.                     |
| 10   | Deploy pod using the new ServiceAccount.                                            | Pod authenticates to Vault with new UID.                        |
| 11   | Check Vault license usage.                                                          | **2 licenses** consumed (new UID counted as separate identity). |


âœ… Validation
Vault associates clients by identity alias.

When alias_name_source = serviceaccount_uid, Vault uses the UID of the Kubernetes service account for alias creation.

Even if the name of the service account is reused, a new UID results in a new client entry in Vault, consuming an additional license.

ðŸ§  Conclusion
Vault client licensing is UID-based when using alias_name_source = serviceaccount_uid.

This ensures that even if a ServiceAccount is deleted and recreated with the same name, it is treated as a distinct identity by Vault.

This test case validates the correct behavior of Vault's licensing mechanism in Kubernetes environments.
