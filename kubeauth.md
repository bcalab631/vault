List of Steps
Log in to Vault:

Authenticate to Vault using a root token or another valid authentication method.
Enable Kubernetes Authentication Method:

Enable the Kubernetes authentication method in Vault, which allows Kubernetes service account tokens to be used for authentication.
Obtain Kubernetes API Server URL:

Retrieve the URL of the Kubernetes API server used by your OpenShift cluster.
Obtain Kubernetes CA Certificate:

Fetch the Kubernetes CA certificate used to verify the authenticity of Kubernetes service account tokens.
Configure Kubernetes Authentication in Vault:

Provide Vault with the Kubernetes API server URL and the CA certificate so that Vault can authenticate using service account tokens.
Create a Vault Role for Kubernetes Authentication:

Define a Vault role that binds Kubernetes service accounts to specific Vault policies, defining what secrets can be accessed and what permissions are granted.
Create a Kubernetes Service Account:

In OpenShift, create a service account that the application pods will use to authenticate with Vault.
Create a Kubernetes Role Binding:

Optionally, create a role binding for the service account to grant it access to specific Kubernetes resources or namespaces.
Deploy an Application Pod with the Service Account:

Deploy a pod using the created Kubernetes service account so it can authenticate with Vault and access secrets.
Authenticate with Vault from the Pod:

From inside the pod, authenticate using the Kubernetes service account's token to obtain a Vault token.
Access Secrets from Vault:

Once authenticated, use the Vault token to retrieve the secrets from Vault, based on the policies assigned to the Kubernetes role.
Create and Assign Vault Policies:

Define Vault policies that control access to specific secrets or paths, ensuring the correct permissions are assigned to the Kubernetes role.
Verify Authentication and Secret Access:

Test the authentication and secret access process by attempting to retrieve secrets from Vault using the configured service account.
By following these steps, OpenShift pods can securely authenticate to Vault and access secrets without storing sensitive data in OpenShiftâ€™s ETCD.
