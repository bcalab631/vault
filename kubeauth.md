| **Test Case #** | **Test Case**                                  | **Objective** | **Steps** | **Expected Result** |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------|---------------------|
| 1               | Vault Kubernetes Authentication Backend       | Ensure Vault Kubernetes auth method is enabled | Verify via `vault auth list` | `kubernetes/` method should be listed as enabled |
| 2               | Vault Kubernetes Auth Configuration           | Ensure correct configuration with Kubernetes API | Verify Kubernetes API URL and CA cert configuration | Correct configuration with Kubernetes API URL and CA cert |
| 3               | Kubernetes Service Account Token Authentication | Validate token-based authentication | Use service account token to authenticate | Vault returns a valid authentication token |
| 4               | Vault Role Bound to Service Account           | Verify Vault role binding with service account | Check role configuration in Vault | Role bound to the correct service account and policies |
| 5               | Vault Policies for Service Account            | Ensure policies are assigned to service account | Verify policies assigned in Vault role | Correct policies assigned and access granted based on policy |
| 6               | Token Expiration and Renewal                  | Validate token TTL and renewal process | Check token TTL and renew before expiration | Token expires and renews correctly within TTL |
| 7               | Role Bindings for Multiple Service Accounts   | Validate role supports multiple service accounts | Test multiple service accounts under a single role | Multiple service accounts can authenticate using the same role |
| 8               | Access Denied for Unauthorized Service Account | Ensure unauthorized service accounts are denied access | Attempt to authenticate with an unauthorized service account | Vault denies access with "access denied" error |
| 9               | Authentication with OpenShift Default Service Account | Test default service account authentication | Attempt to authenticate with default service account token | Default service account is denied access unless explicitly allowed |
| 10              | OpenShift Vault Secret Access                 | Verify Vault secrets can be accessed by Kubernetes pods | Configure pod to retrieve secrets using Vault service account | Pod successfully retrieves Vault secrets with correct policies |
